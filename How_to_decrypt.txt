To decrypt an SRTP Audio stream run

srtpdecrypt decrypt <SSRC> <Key> <input_file>

Example:
srtpdecrypt decrypt 0x4ebd56e3 fCaLYx1IEhD62eKqFIGOk1qykNikYcamkFVkde1b input.pcap


The input_file is the packet capture file that contains the audio stream. Note the input file has to be in tcpdump pcap format;
pcapng format is not supported.

The Key is the 40 byte string that contains the key material for the Audio stream encryption. Grab this key from a SIP trace or
from a log file that contains SIP traffic. The key exchange in SIP traffic is defined in RFC4568,
example: AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80 inline:fCaLYx1IEhD62eKqFIGOk1qykNikYcamkFVkde1b|2^31|1:1.
Make sure you identify the correct key for the SRTP Audio stream that you want to decrypt.

The Synchronization source identifier (SSRC) uniquely identifies the source of a stream,
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol. Identify the SSRC of the SRTP Audio stream
you want to decrypt in Wireshark or by running srtpdecrypt analyze <input_file>. Specify the SSRC with a
preceding 0x in the command line.



srtpdecrypt will create output files depending on the codec used in the Audio stream.

If the codec is G.711 PCMA or G.711 PCMU, srtpdecrypt creates a .wav file that can be played directly.

If the codec is G.722, srtpdecrypt creates a raw file with .g722 extension. You can use ffmpeg to convert this to a wav file:
ffmpeg -i raw.g722 out.wav

If the codec is SILK/8000, srtpdecrypt creates a SILK SDK binary file with .bin extension.
You can use the SILK SDK decoder tool to convert this to a raw pcm file, which can then be converted to .wav using ffmpeg:
decoder.exe output-SILK8000.bit help.pcm -Fs_API 8000
ffmpeg.exe -f s16le -ar 8000 -i help.pcm out.wav

If the codec is SILK/16000, srtpdecrypt creates a SILK SDK binary file with .bin extension.
You can use the SILK SDK decoder tool to convert this to a raw pcm file, which can then be converted to .wav using ffmpeg:
decoder.exe output-SILK16000.bit help.pcm -Fs_API 16000
ffmpeg.exe -f s16le -ar 16000 -i help.pcm out.wav

(Note: the decoder tool executable is included in the srtpdecrypt repository for convenience. You better grab the SILK SDK
from https://github.com/gaozehua/SILKCodec and compile the decoder tool yourself.)

Codecs other than G.711, G.722 and SILK/8000 or SILK/16000 are not supported.






To detect RTP streams in a .pcap file run

srtpdecrypt analyze <input_file>

Example:
srtpdecrypt analyze input.pcap
